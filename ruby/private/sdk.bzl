    A special version "system" will use whatever version of ruby is installed
    on the host system.  Besides that, this rules supports all of versions in
    the SUPPORTED_VERSIONS list.  The most recent matching version will be
    selected.

    If the current system ruby doesn't match a given version, it will be
    downloaded and built for use by the toolchain.  Toolchain selection occurs
    based on the //ruby/runtime:version flag setting.

    For example,
        rules_ruby_register_toolchains(["system", ruby-2.5", "jruby-9.2"])` will
    download and build the latest supported version of Ruby 2.5 and jruby 9.2.
    By default, the system ruby will be used for all Bazel build and
    tests.  However, passing a flag such as:
        --@rules_ruby//ruby/runtime:version="ruby-2.5"
    will select the Ruby 2.5 installation.
